/**
 * This class demonstrates some of the operations that can be performed on directed graphs. After
 * constructing a basic directed graph, it computes all the strongly connected components of this
 * graph. It then finds the shortest path from one vertex to another using Dijkstra's shortest path
 * algorithm. The sample code should help to clarify to users of JGraphT that the class
 * org.jgrapht.alg.shortestpath.DijkstraShortestPath can be used to find shortest paths within
 * directed graphs.
